## Why not Docker?

Sure. 

The author loves/d Docker, and the same steps can be done using it just as well. But Docker's heavy, and their recent steps seem to bring it only deeper into that direction. So I guess it's about *business models*. Canonical backing both Ubuntu and Multipass makes sense, and they develop Multipass with a least-frills approach (meaning: low learning curve; high productivity!).
